# Pomodoro Timer

This project is part of The Odin Project's Web Development 101 curriculum. The description of this project can be found [here.](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/pairing-project)

This project is meant to be an introduction to pair programming, but I build this project independently. 

The timer is hosted [here.](https://shailavasthi.github.io/pomodoro_timer/)
